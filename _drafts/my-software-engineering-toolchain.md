My software engineering toolchain for the last few years has been pretty consistant:

* Language: C++ (11/14)
* Build generator: CMake (3)
* Compiler: GNU GCC (4.9)
* Debugger: GNU GDB
* Memory profiler: Valgrind
* Source control: Git
* Scripting: Python (3)
* Editor: Vim
* OS: Ubuntu (14 LTS

However, there have been some additions over the past year that have really started to change my toolchain.
