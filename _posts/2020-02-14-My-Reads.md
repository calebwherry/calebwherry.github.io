These are all my reads over the past few years. I started keeping track of this list in 2018 to better know what I was reading. I'd like to make
it a better fomat at some point but this is the easiest way to do it so keeping it for now.

Note: Under 'Issue/Volume', '#' denotes a single comic issue. Otherwise, it is a collection.

* Type Key:
    * AB - audio book
    * B - book
    * C - comic
    * GN - graphic novel
    * M - manga
