These are all the things I have read over the past few years. I started keeping track of this list
in 2018 to better know what I was reading. I'd like to make it a better fomat at some point but
this is the easiest way to do it so keeping it for now. Will probably change publish data every year
too so it stays somewhat at the top of the posts.
