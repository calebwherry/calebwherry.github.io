As I start my new job as a Research Engineer, I am hoping to have a lot more time on my hands to continue some of my readings. I am always interested in new areas of science and new perspectives on old ideas. Below are a few of the books I am currently reading and a short blurb about what I think of them so far. Enjoy!

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Road-Reality-Complete-Guide-Universe/dp/0679454438">Road To Reality by Sir Roger Penrose</a>

> Awesome book so far and one of the most comprehensive texts I have ever read on anything. Roger Penrose is a master Mathematical Physicist and
> does a brilliant job at explaining a ton of ideas extremely well. The exercises are very interesting so far and I enjoy working them when I have
> time. I plan on spending a lot more time on the exercises in the next few months. If I had to recommend one book to anyone in the sciences, this
> would be it!

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184628886X/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=038794768X&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0KGRT4A50R7749SFDEAB">Explorations In Quantum Computing by Colin P. Williams</a>

> I am on Chapter 3 of this book and as of now, I think it is a good text for someone who already has a good understanding of both quantum
> computation and quantum mechanics. It seems that some of the information is misplaced and Colin goes into too much detail too early in the book,
> mainly in some of the examples. He introduces some concepts without explaining them (such as the Pauli gates) and doesn't get around the telling
> you what they are till about 50 pages later. This is why I think that this book is more for the reader who knows a little about the subject.
> Other than that, I love the book. Colin gives a great introduction to the field and gives very interesting examples that I have not seen other
> places. I hope the rest is as good as what I have already read!

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-Cambridge-Sciences/dp/0521635039">Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Michael Nielsen & Isaac Chuang</a>

> An amazing book that I should have read cover to cover years ago. It is THE text on quantum computing and is extremely in depth and provides the
> best introduction to the subject around. I recommend reading this text and then picking up Colin's book above for a more "Computer Science and
> Computer Engineering" viewpoint on the subject. Everyone who is anyone in quantum computation knows that this book is a great book. Peter Shor,
> Charles Bennet, and Michael Freedman all are recommenders for this book and they give it praise (if you don't know who these people are, look
> them up and you will see my point). Read it!

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Reality-Parallel-Universes-Implications/dp/014027541X">The Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch</a>

> I am not very far into this book yet and I am sad to say it has taken me this long to start reading it. David is one of the founders of the field
> of quantum computing and I love many of his views on fundamental physics. I look forward to finishing this book quite soon.

Hopefully I will be finishing these books in the next few months and continuing onto other ones. I have a ton books on my bookshelf and I assume I will be adding to them just out of shear love for reading (and buying books!). We shall see how it goes, just thought I would gather my thoughts on which books I am currently reading.
