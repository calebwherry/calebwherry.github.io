<p>I just installed a new plugin for embedding code into my posts. I had to do some edits to my custom Wordpress theme so here goes nothing:</p>
<p>[code language="cpp" highlight="9,23,24"]<br />
// Here are some comments.<br />
// They are pretty awesome, right?</p>
<p>// And some nice whitespace above, let's see how that comes out.<br />
// Also, what about a reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly long line.<br />
// Alright, looks good. Let's do some syntax highlighting, should be C++ since I used the cpp tags...</p>
<p>namespace matrix {</p>
<p>  class Matrix {</p>
<p>    private:<br />
      int rowSize;<br />
      int colSize;</p>
<p>    public:<br />
      Matrix(): rowSize(0), colSize(0)<br />
      {<br />
         // Do some stuff...<br />
      }</p>
<p>      int getRowSize() { return rowSize; };<br />
      int getColSize() { return colSize; };</p>
<p>      virtual ~Matrix();<br />
  };</p>
<p>} // End matrix namespace<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>And that about sums it up! Looks pretty good I think. I highlighted lines 9, 23, and 24 which is neat. On ChromeOS, as I add more and more lines, there is some weird offset that gets worse and worse SO that after about 30 lines, the numbering is off by a whole line. Might work on that at some point but not now.</p>
