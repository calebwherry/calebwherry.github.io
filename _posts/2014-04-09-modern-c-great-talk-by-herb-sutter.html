<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Sutter" target="_blank">Herb Sutter</a> gives a great talk on some of the new directions, new paradigms, and reasons why modern C++ is a great language in the video below. Lots of nice nuggets too about the language that many people gloss over and/or forget. I especially like the section about 'real' arrays (contiguous memory layout) and the tremendous benefit you can get from a prefetcher. I'm pretty blown away with the results of the vector and linked-list insertion/deletion benchmark, seems remarkable! Watch the video to find out more. </p>
<p>It's kind of long but very interesting if you like C++ and the new C++11/14/17 standards!</p>
