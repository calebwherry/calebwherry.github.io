Recently at IQC there was a week long summer school for high school students called Quantum Cryptography School for Young Students (QCSYS). I had the pleasure of being a Mentor and House Parent to the students during this summer school. I was extremely impressed by the caliber of students that came to this summer school. They asked intriguing questions and absorbed mathematical notations and concepts at a very high pace. I was not expecting this to be honest. I come from a high school where people barely understood calculus let alone linear algebra and Dirac notation! A link can be found here with information about the whole program. The whole group is below:
