Recently Dave Bacon ditched his life as a Quantum Computer Scientist/Physicist and took up a post at Google as a Software Engineer. I commend him on his new appointment and am happy to see that he has relinquished his powers at <a href="http://dabacon.org/pontiff/">The Quantum Pontiff</a> and appointed a set of 3 new quantum pontificators:

* <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-bennetc">Charlie Bennett</a>
* Aram Harrow
* <a href="http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/sflammia/">Steve Flammia</a>

These three people are brilliant physicists/computer scientists/mathematicians that have each made their impacts in Quantum Computation (and Science in general). Bennett is an IBM Fellow, Harrow is currently a lecturer at the University of Bristol (on leave at University of Washington where Dave just left), and Flammia who was a Postdoc at Perimeter until recently where he moved to IQI at CalTech. I think this selection of giants in the field was an excellent choice and I am looking forward to what they are going to pontificate on in the future!
