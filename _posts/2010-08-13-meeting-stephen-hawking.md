It was a great pleasure of mine this summer to get to meet the world famous Stephen Hawking while working at the Institute for Quantum Computing and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. Stephen Hawking is a Distinguished Research Chair at PI and spends at least 1 month a year visiting PI. This summer he was around for the commencement of the first class of the PSI program at PI. Along with this he also does research in Quantum Cosmology and Quantum Foundations, among other things. I had the pleasure of meeting him and getting a picture:
