<p>
I was worried about my website being slow to render today (because of some scripts I wrote) so I started searching online for some sites that would show me how long it took to fetch and execute all my content on each page. I found a very nice tool over at <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/">PingDom</a>. It will break down all the includes you use and tell you how long it took to start and finish the fetch. Pretty useful. I also came across this one as well: <a href="http://browsershots.org/">Browser Shots</a>. It will render your page in 70+ different browsers and give you snapshots of them all. A great tool for people who are developing their website from scratch and are worried about cross browser compatibility!</p>
