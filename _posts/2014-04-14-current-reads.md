Current reads! I like to write these every once-in-a-while to clear my thoughts and get a handle on what I need to finish up on my reading list. I have a bad habit of reading books halfway and never finishing them.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Multiprocessor-Programming-Revised-Reprint/dp/0123973376http://www.amazon.com/The-Multiprocessor-Programming-Revised-Reprint/dp/0123973376" target="_blank">The Art of Multiprocessor Programming</a> (Maurice Herlihy & Nir Shavit)

> I was kind of doubtful of this book at first but that was mainly because I didn't know what to expect from a book on multiprocessing. We are using
> this text for my graduate course on Multiprocessor Programming and I have actually been fairly surprised at how good it is. Everything is written in
> Java but for the most part you can easily find the equivalent statements in C++ (especially with the new C++11 standard). It lays out a lot of neat
> examples that, for the most part, are not contrived. The problems are sufficiently hard and provide some nice looks into real-world uses of
> concurrent objects/algorithms. We should be getting through the whole book so hopefully I can write a full-blown review at some point this summer!

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/C-Concurrency-Action-Practical-Multithreading/dp/1933988770" target="_blank">C++ Concurrency in Action: Practical Multithreading</a> (Anthony Williams)

> I am using this book as a supplement to my Multiprocessor Programming graduate course and as the main text to help out with

> GARTH (Genetic AlgoRiTHms) using C++11: A Framework for Concurrent GAs" target="_blank">my project</a> since it is C++11 based. I haven't had too
> much time to really dig into the book but there are A LOT of good code examples. If you don't know advanced C++ though I think this book will be a
> little bit of an uphill struggle.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Numerical-High-Performance-Computers-Software-Environments/dp/0898714281" target="_blank">Numerical Linear Algebra for High-Performance Computing</a> (Jack Dongarra)

> I started this book last semester for my Numerical Analysis & Software graduate course but never got past the first few chapters. I like the layout
> of the book and have heard it is a foundational book for Numerical Linear Algebra on HPC systems. I just need to find the time to finish it!

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Theoretical-Minimum-Start-Doing-Physics/dp/0465075681" target="_blank">The Theoretical Minimum</a> (Leonard Susskind) 

> Just like the Dongarra book above, I got through the first few chapters and just haven't had time to pick it back up. I love the examples and think
> Susskind does a great job at explaining concepts of classical mechanics. I am looking forward to reading the follow-up book to this one on Quantum
> Mechanics (if I can ever finish this one!).

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Simpsons-Their-Mathematical-Secrets/dp/1620402777" target="_blank">The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets</a> (Simon Singh)

> This is the only book on the list that I haven't actually started yet (except for like the first few pages and I don't even remember what they said).
> I have seen some <a href="http://www.numberphile.com/" target="_blank">Numberphile videos</a> with Simon which were awesome so I am looking forward
> to the book very much!

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Queen-Damned-Vampire-Chronicles-No/dp/0345351525" target="_blank">The Queen of the Damned</a> (Ann Rice)

> This is the third installment of Rice's Vampire Chronicles and I love them! This one brings together A LOT of back story on A LOT of vampires which
> is always awesome. Just as with Tolkien, I love the development of the world the characters live in and their history. I'm trying to hack through the
> entire series but keep getting distracted with lame things like work/eating/bills/etc.

I am hoping to finish most of these by the end of the summer. I would really like to get through at least half of the Vampire Chronicles so that I can start working on some of the books I got for Xmas!
