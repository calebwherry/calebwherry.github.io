<p>The Feynman lectures are now free online: <a href="http://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">http://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/</a></p>
<p>Although only the first volume is available (others are in the works), this is pretty awesome! The pages are as beautiful as the \(\LaTeX\) 50th anniversary printed versions I have. I am glad that they decided to tackle this project, it shows that people are still very involved in preserving works that have been so influential to generations of students. Bringing these volumes more alive with HTML5 and MathJax is a brilliant idea and I would love to see some of graphs and experiments made interactive eventually. </p>
