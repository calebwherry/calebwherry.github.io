<p><a href="http://www.popsci.com/article/gadgets/video-game-makes-surreal-puzzles-forced-perspective">One of the coolest games I have ever seen</a>! Seriously, this thing is AWESOME! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_perspective" target="_blank">Forced perspective</a> is such a neat technique it seems crazy that a game like this hasn't been created before (or has it? I can't find anything on one...).</p>
<p>I especially love <a href="http://youtu.be/HOfll06X16c?t=6m3s" target="_blank">this part</a> where that player can get smaller and smaller as they go through linked doorways/portals. So cool!</p>
