> tl;dr: Great book. Go buy it, now.

This is a great book for people interested in C++, even experts. It's definitely a very nice addition to the library and should probably be read by anyone wanting to learn C++ anew these days. I have already recommended it to a few friends of mine who have been wanting to pick up some knowledge of C++. The length makes it an approachable text (just under 200 pages) and it has plenty of references to Stroustrup's main C++ book <em>The C++ Programming Language</em> (which isn't for the faint of heart but is <em>the</em> text for C++).

With the ratification of the C++11 standard by the ISO committee, many texts on C++ became outdated immediately, in my opinion. I would love to see this text adopted by intro CS classes that teach C++. It provides a high level overview of so many aspects of C++ that books 3 times as long don't cover (ex: template meta-programming and multi-processsor programming).

All-in-all a great book and a worthwhile investment!
