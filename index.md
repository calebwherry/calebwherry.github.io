Welcome to my site! I used to be a lot more active here but have since backed away from it. Poke around it you like, there are blogs and resumes and research topics scattered (sometimes behind non-linked pages).

I have a lot of different interests so feel free to hit me up if we have overlap: software engineering, quantum computing, mathematics, reading, books, kayaking, food.
