#### Computational & Topological Optimization Techniques In Genetic Algorithms

This project is on-going and contains many different aspects. Most of the parts are in collaboration with <a href="http://www.robertdfrench.me">Robert D. French</a>

#### Shor's Quantum Factoring Algorithm

Ever since visiting MIT for a Quantum Information Science summer school back in 2009, I have loved Quantum Computation. I decided to take a look at the most iconic algorithm in the area for my undergraduate senior thesis.

**Wherry, J.C.** *A Complexity Analysis of Shor's Quantum Factoring Algorithm* [<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9aId9jAWLcQOXkyR0I2cGFCSzQ/edit">PDF</a>]

#### Optimal Control of Quantum Computing Systems: A Genetic Approach

Work done while at the Institute for Quantum Computing in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

#### Quantum Speedups of Inverse Problems in General Relativity & Differential Geometry

Work done while at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

#### Fractals: Julia and Mandelbrot Sets

I worked on fractals when I was in undergrad with Dr. Ben Ntatin. It was a very interesting project and the route that Dr. Ntatin took was much different than I initially thought it was going to be.
