## Resume - One pager

Short, to the point one page resume for those "6 second flybys".

## Resume - Extended

Longer resume with all positions and details filled in along with other information. I used to have a full blown CV but since I am not focusing on original research anymore and more on infrastrusture and tooling for research, an extended resume seemed to be more fitting.
